    <string name="infoAbout">The App was conceived by Patrick Monetti as an extension of the Blue Ridge Re-Entry Council founded by Steve Monetti in 2012, centered in Lynchburg Virginia.   As a result, this app is designed to be a reference point for all available resources in the greater Lynchburg area for those in need of any type of assistance. Here you will find links to church food pantries, private organizations that assist with medical, heating/cooling bills, and government entities for subsidized assistance programs. There are also contacts for government funded education courses, licensing and Child Support Enforcement, as well as counseling and support services.</string>
